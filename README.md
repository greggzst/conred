# Conred

You often have to embed video from YouTube and Vimeo to your web site? Wouldn't it be nice if we had a gem that could make video embedding from URL's easy as pie? BOOM. Here you go.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'conred'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install conred

## Usage

### Iframe generator for YouTube and Vimeo videos:

```ruby
c = Conred::Video.new(
	video_url: "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNtW9pGFPTA&feature=plcp", 
	width: 285, 
	height: 185,
	error_message: "Video url is invalid"
)
```

Then you can get your ready embed code like this (Conred will recognize video provider by itself):

```ruby
# In your Rails view you will need to append .html_safe
c.code.html_safe
```
    
You can also check if it is YouTube or Vimeo video like this:

```ruby
c.youtube_video? #=> true
c.vimeo_video? #=> false
```
    
Or if it exists:

```ruby
c.exist? # => true
```
